# Elevator
An elevator is a simple mechanism that moves something up or down. This lesson will introduce some basic concepts in controls by helping you through programming an elevator.

## Why an Elevator?

Controlling elevators is simple because they have only one degree of freedom and are remarkably consistent. The same amount of power applied to a motor should almost always produce the exact same motion from the elevator.

This makes them easier to control compared to something like an arm, where the force of gravity changes depending on the angle of the arm (imagine hanging your arm straight down vs. horizontal, parallel to the ground: more force is needed to maintain the angle when your arm is horizontal).

First, install the required software. Good instructions on this can be found in [zero to robot](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html). For java programming, you will need to [install the game tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) and then [install WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).
